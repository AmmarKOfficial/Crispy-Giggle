<h2>Introduction</h2>
A comparator is a combinational logic circuit that compares two binary numbers and determines their relationship, such as whether one is greater than or equal to the other. In this project, we designed a 4 bit comparator using 2 bit comparators in Verilog. The goal was to demonstrate our understanding of digital systems design principles and our ability to implement them using a hardware description language.

<h2>Project Description</h2>
The project involved designing a 4 bit comparator using 2 bit comparators and other combinational logic circuits in Verilog. We started by analyzing the binary comparison operation and identifying the Verilog modules required to implement it. Then, we designed the 2 bit comparator module and integrated four of them to create the 4 bit comparator module.

<h2>Design Process</h2>
The design process involved the following steps:
<ul>
Analyzing the binary comparison operation
Identifying the Verilog modules required for the 2 bit comparator
Designing the 2 bit comparator module
Testing and verifying the 2 bit comparator module
Integrating four 2 bit comparators to create the 4 bit comparator module
Testing and verifying the 4 bit comparator module
We used a Verilog simulator to simulate the modules and verify their functionality.
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
After designing and testing the modules, we found that the 4 bit comparator worked correctly for all possible input combinations. We tested the circuit by comparing different binary numbers of 4 bits and observing the output. The simulation results were consistent with the expected behavior of a comparator.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Overall, the project was a success and demonstrated our ability to design and implement a digital systems circuit using Verilog. We learned the principles of digital systems design and the use of hardware description languages, as well as the importance of testing and verifying a circuit to ensure its correctness. The 4 bit comparator module can be used as a building block in more complex digital systems, and can be modified and optimized as needed.
