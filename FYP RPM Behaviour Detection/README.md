<h1>Remote Patient Monitoring for Early Detection of Selfharm Behaviour Using SDR Technology</h1>
    <p>This is the repository for my Final Year Project (FYP) which focuses on the development of a remote patient monitoring system for early detection of selfharm behaviour using Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology.</p>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The project focuses on the domains of IoT, AI and Communication systems. The system uses SDR technology to collect data from different sensors placed on a patient's body, such as ECG, EEG, and temperature sensors. The data is then transmitted wirelessly to a Raspberry Pi 4, which serves as a central hub for the system. The data is processed and analysed using machine learning algorithms in Python, which can detect patterns and anomalies in the patient's behaviour that may indicate selfharm tendencies. The results are displayed on a web interface developed using React, HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap. The system also includes LabVIEW and MATLAB for data analysis and visualisation.</p>
    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Web Development: React, HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap</li>
      <li>Python for Machine Learning</li>
      <li>LabVIEW and MATLAB for data analysis and visualisation</li>
      <li>Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4 and different sensors, USRP kit for SDR technology</li>
    </ul>
